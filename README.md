## Instructor

[Will Button](https://egghead.io/instructors/will-button)

## Course Goal

In this course, you will learn the basics of using Elasticsearch within your application. You will learn how to store and retrieve data in Elasticsearch as well as how to leverage its powerful search features.

You will be able to design indices, types and maps for your application to leverage the most from Elasticsearch and you will learn how to monitor the health and performance of your Elasticsearch servers to identify and resolve capacity issues before they impact your application.
