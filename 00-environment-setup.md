# 00. Environment Setup

In order to fully benefit from this course, it is recommended to use the course's GitHub repo. Make your way over to the [repository](https://github.com/rekibnikufesin/elasticsearch-intro) and fork it. Once that's completed, clone the repo onto your machine using `git clone [repo SSH key]`. 

Follow the "Setting Up" guidelines within the repository's README. Once you have successfully gotten the environment up and running, jump into the first video of the course!
